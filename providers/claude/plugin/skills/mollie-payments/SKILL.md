  Activate this skill when a developer is working with Mollie: integrating payments,
  setting up Mollie Connect for a platform/marketplace, building recurring payments or
  subscriptions, issuing refunds or captures, investigating chargebacks or settlements,
  or troubleshooting a Mollie integration. This includes: accepting credit card payments,
  embedding Mollie Components (card fields), setting up a checkout flow, handling payment
  redirects, verifying webhooks, handling payment status updates, integrating Mollie in
  Next.js / React / Vue / vanilla JS, setting up Mollie in a backend (Node.js, PHP,
  Python), creating payments via the API, using the Mollie SDK, handling card
  tokenisation, 3D Secure, Mollie.js, mollie-api-node, PCI compliance, card form, hosted
  checkout, payment links, iDEAL, credit card, SEPA, Klarna, Apple Pay, Google Pay,
  Bancontact, building a checkout, custom checkout, payment methods, Mollie Connect,
  OAuth onboarding, submerchants, application fees, mandates, customers API,
  subscriptions, recurring charges, refunds, captures, chargebacks, settlements,
  reconciliation, payment stuck or pending, webhook not received, 401/403 errors,
  sales invoices, revenue collection, B2B invoicing, invoicing customers, payment
  terms, VAT invoice.

# Mollie Payments

Use `<references/product-selection/routing-guide.md>` for the full decision tree if
a request spans more than one dimension below (e.g. "recurring payments for my
marketplace clients"). The steps here cover the common single-dimension case.

## Step 1 — Is this new integration work, or something else?

**Ask this first, before anything else:**

> Are you setting up something new, fixing a problem with an existing integration,
> upgrading/migrating an existing one, or building an AI agent that uses Mollie?

- **Something isn't working** (stuck payment, missing webhook, auth error, wrong
  credentials) → go straight to `<references/troubleshooting/>`. Do not generate new
  integration code before ruling out a known issue.
- **Upgrading an SDK version or migrating from an older API** → this is the
  `mollie-upgrade` skill, not this one.
- **Building an agent that calls Mollie autonomously** (via `@mollie/agent-toolkit`,
  or exposing Mollie as LLM tools) → this is the `mollie-agent-toolkit` skill.
- **Refunding, capturing, or investigating existing payments/chargebacks/settlements**
  → `<references/operations/>`.
- **Invoicing a customer to be paid later** (B2B billing, payment terms, VAT line
  items — not a real-time checkout) → this is Sales Invoices (Revenue Collection),
  a distinct product from the Payments API. Go straight to
  `<references/payments/sales-invoices.md>` — skip Steps 2–6 below, they don't apply.
- **New integration** → continue to Step 2.

---

## Step 2 — Direct merchant or platform?

> Are you building this for your own business (accepting payments directly as a
> merchant), or are you building a platform or marketplace that processes payments
> on behalf of other businesses?

**If they are a platform or marketplace** → this needs Mollie Connect, not a
standard integration. Route to `<references/connect/oauth-and-onboarding.md>` and
work through the Connect reference set — it covers OAuth, onboarding, application
fees, permissions/tokens, and testing/offboarding. Everything in Steps 3–5 below
still applies once Connect is set up (a platform can still need recurring payments
or hosted checkout — just executed via a client's access token).

**If they are a direct merchant** → continue to Step 3.

---

## Step 3 — One-time or recurring?

> Is this a single checkout, or does the customer get charged again later without
> re-entering their payment details (subscription, saved card, usage billing)?

**Recurring** → route to `<references/recurring/customers-and-mandates.md>` — this
is a distinct flow (Customers API → first payment → mandate → subscription or
on-demand charge), not a variant of one-time checkout. Webhook handling still
applies (`<references/payments/webhooks.md>`), but skip Step 4 below.

**One-time** → continue to Step 4.

---

## Step 4 — Understand their checkout preference

> How much control do you want over the payment experience?
>
> **A) Mollie-hosted checkout** — Mollie handles the entire payment page. Simplest to
> integrate; no frontend work required. Customers are redirected to Mollie to
> complete payment.
>
> **B) Build your own checkout** — You embed payment method selection and
> (optionally) card fields directly in your UI. More work, but full control over
> design and branding.
>
> **C) Payment link** — No embedded checkout at all. You share a URL with the
> customer (email, SMS, chat, QR code) instead of redirecting from a live session.
> Use this when there's no checkout page to redirect from — phone/mail orders,
> donations, social selling. (A formal invoice with payment terms/VAT lines is a
> different product — see Step 1's Sales Invoices branch.)
>
> Not sure? Hosted checkout takes ~30 minutes and handles everything for you. A
> custom checkout takes longer but keeps customers on your page throughout. If
> there's no live session to redirect from in the first place, it's a payment link,
> not A or B.

---

## Step 5 — Understand their stack

Before writing any code, ask:

> What language and framework are you using?
> - Backend: Node.js / PHP / Python / other?
> - Frontend: React / Vue / Next.js / vanilla JS / other?
> - Are you in test mode or live?

Use the answers to generate code with the correct SDK and idioms.

---

## Step 6 — Route to the correct reference

| Checkout preference | Card handling | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Mollie-hosted checkout | Mollie handles card UI | `<references/payments/hosted-checkout.md>` |
| Build your own — embed card fields | Mollie Components (Mollie.js) | `<references/payments/components.md>` |
| Build your own — other methods only | Methods API + Payments API | `<references/payments/build-your-own-checkout.md>` |
| Payment link — no embedded checkout, share a URL | Mollie handles card UI | `<references/payments/payment-links.md>` |

All integrations require webhook handling — always include it: `<references/payments/webhooks.md>`

---

## SDK selection

Always use the official Mollie SDK for the developer's language:

| Language | Package |
|---|---|
| JavaScript / TypeScript / Node.js | `mollie-api-typescript` |
| PHP | `mollie/mollie-api-php` (Composer) |
| Python | `mollie-api-py` |

`@mollie/api-client` (Node) and `mollie-api-python` are the old/community SDKs —
don't use them for new integrations. If a developer already has one installed,
that's a migration case for the `mollie-upgrade` skill, not a new build.

Always use the v2 API. Never construct raw API calls when an SDK is available.

**Never use the Orders API for a new integration** — it's deprecated. Always build
against the Payments API (`payments.create`, etc.), including hold-then-capture
flows (`captureMode: 'manual'`, see `<references/operations/captures.md>`) that the
Orders API used to handle via Shipments. If a developer's existing code already uses
the Orders API, that's a migration case — route to the `mollie-upgrade` skill rather
than extending the old API.

---

## Critical rules — apply to every integration

- **Never** put API keys (`live_xxx` / `test_xxx`) in frontend code. Only the profile ID (`pfl_xxx`) belongs in the browser.
- **Always** verify payment status via webhook before fulfilling an order — never trust the redirect URL alone.
- **Always** respond with HTTP 200 to webhook requests before doing any async work. Mollie retries on any other status.
- **Always** redirect customers to the checkout URL using HTTP GET (303 See Other), never POST.
- The profile ID used in `Mollie()` on the frontend **must** belong to the same account as the API key used on the backend.
- In test mode, pass `testmode: true` to `Mollie()` on the frontend AND use a test API key (`test_xxx`) on the backend. Both must match.
- When a card payment fails, create a **new card token** and a **new payment** — you cannot retry on the same payment.
- Never show a payment result to the customer until the webhook has been received and processed.
- **Additionally**, for any refund, capture, or cancellation: read `<references/operations/write-action-safety.md>` before generating the code — these are harder to reverse than a payment creation.
